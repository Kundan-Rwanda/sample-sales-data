# Sample Sales JSON Dataset:

This Repository on GitHub, a comprehensive collection of JSON datasets meticulously sourced and curated to provide valuable insights into global sales dynamics. These datasets were accessed as raw data from the following resources:

1. [Countries Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/ca-sample-sales-data/master/countries.json)
2. [Customers Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/ca-sample-sales-data/master/customers.json)
3. [Orders Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/ca-sample-sales-data/master/orders.json)
4. [Products Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/ca-sample-sales-data/master/products.json)
5. [Sales Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/ca-sample-sales-data/master/sales.json)

However, **it's important to note that the raw data contained trailing data and extra whitespace issues within the above JSON files.** To ensure data integrity and usability, Kundan Kumar undertook the task of transforming and cleaning the datasets. Subsequently, **the cleaned datasets were uploaded to this repository for easy access and use by individuals interested in studying global sales patterns and trends.**
